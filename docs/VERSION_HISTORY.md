# Version history

This repository preserves the development artifacts that still exist. Historical builds are included for comparison and archaeology, not as recommended installations.

## Original dashboard reference — build 2026.08.24.12

File: [`original/waz.dashboard-reference-2026.08.24.12.plg`](../original/waz.dashboard-reference-2026.08.24.12.plg)

This was the compact System/Cooling dashboard plugin used as the starting reference. It included fast CPU sampling, logical-CPU rows, rolling averages, a five-minute graph, power and cooling data, and early pool cards. It did not contain the current unified Health banner, Workloads inspector, Storage panel, plugin integrations, or final layout.

## Dashboard development milestones — v0.4.x through v0.6.x

These were rolling test packages copied directly to the reference server and were not retained as release artifacts. The surviving source and conversation notes show the progression:

- v0.4.x expanded the System panel with CPU topology, RAM, GPU, network, rack power, coolant flow, and HBA temperatures.
- v0.5.x added the full Storage panel, parity scheduling, pool selectors, physical Disk Location maps, and the dynamic Array table.
- v0.6.x added Workloads, FolderView Plus/native Organizer imports, native Docker controls, selected-container telemetry, top processes, and refined attention rules.

No downloadable files are presented for these milestones because the exact packages were not preserved.

## WAZ Control v0.7.0 — build 2026.08.26.16

File: [`releases/waz.dashboard.plg`](../releases/waz.dashboard.plg)

This is the current rolling release. It combines the Health banner, Server Status, Workloads, and Storage under one plugin, migrates the old standalone Health configuration, and exposes Unraid's native Tile Management window from a blue wrench in the WAZ header.
