# WAZ Control

WAZ Control is a custom Unraid dashboard and WebUI project built around one heavily customized server. The current unified build is **v0.8.0**.

> [!WARNING]
> **This is a reference build, not a universal or supported Community Applications plugin.** It depends on specific Unraid plugins, runtime files, sensors, hardware, and WebUI behavior. Expect to adapt configuration or code for another server. Read the [disclaimer](DISCLAIMER.md), [dependencies](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md), and [recovery steps](docs/RECOVERY.md) before installing it.

## What v0.8.0 includes

- Sticky full-width Health banner across Unraid WebUI pages
- Live Array, Storage, Cooling, and UPS state with an expandable fault-detail row
- Three matched Dashboard panels: Server Status, Workloads, and Storage
- CPU topology, per-thread use, rolling load history, RAM, GPU, networking, rack power, coolant, flow, and HBA temperatures
- Docker folders imported from FolderView Plus or Unraid's Docker Organizer
- Clickable container cards that retain Unraid's native controls and load a dynamic telemetry inspector
- Selected-container CPU, RAM, network, disk I/O, pool/share access, GPU activity, address, port, and status data
- Top four host/Docker CPU processes
- Compact parity state, last/next check timing, dynamic pools, physical disk locations, and a permanent array table
- Decimal storage units and collection paths designed not to wake sleeping array disks
- One installable rolling plugin without permanent edits to Unraid core files
- Host-native MD1200 Top/Bottom fan control with automatic disk-temperature curves
- Average fan RPM in Auto mode and confirmed 20/30/40/50 percent Manual control in the header
- Disabled-by-default migration, Docker-conflict blocking, serial locks, and Back-Up share snapshots

The Docker and Storage panels deliberately use dynamic detail windows. Selecting a Docker folder filters the visible containers; selecting a container loads its live details below. Selecting a pool loads only that pool's member disks while the full Array and physical Disk Location views remain visible.

## Install

The current artifact is [`releases/waz.dashboard.plg`](releases/waz.dashboard.plg). Follow [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md); do not treat the file as a stock one-click package.

Saved development builds and the original dashboard reference are retained for comparison. See [docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md](docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md). They are historical artifacts, not recommended installs.

## Source layout

```text
src/
├── waz-dashboard-plugin/  # unified plugin, panels, collectors, build and verification
└── waz-health-plugin/     # banner component source consumed by the unified build
```

The dashboard build intentionally keeps the banner component beside it and embeds that component under the single `waz.dashboard` runtime during packaging.

## Credit

WAZ Control brings together data and behavior provided by Unraid/Dynamix, Docker Manager and Organizer, FolderView Plus, Disk Location, HBA Viewer, apcupsd/NUT, lm-sensors, and `intel_gpu_top`. See [docs/ATTRIBUTION.md](docs/ATTRIBUTION.md).

The layout, requirements, server-specific decisions, and testing were directed by TheIlluminate92. The PHP, JavaScript, CSS, collectors, packaging, and documentation were developed collaboratively with Codex by OpenAI.
